# 🎉 Weather Pipeline Setup Complete!

## ✅ What's Been Set Up

### 1. **Database Schema** 
- ✅ Supabase database with 4 tables (metadata, stations, observations, historical)
- ✅ Optimized indexes and views for fast queries
- ✅ Row Level Security policies configured

### 2. **Python Pipeline**
- ✅ BoM weather data parser
- ✅ Supabase integration script
- ✅ Automated pipeline runner
- ✅ Environment variables configured

### 3. **Web Dashboard**
- ✅ Next.js application with modern UI
- ✅ Real-time weather cards
- ✅ Historical temperature charts
- ✅ Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## 🚀 How to Use Your System

### **Step 1: Fix Supabase Database**
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of fix_supabase_issues.sql
```

### **Step 2: Run the Pipeline**
```bash
# Go back to the main directory
cd ..

# Run the pipeline manually
python run_weather_pipeline.py manual

# Or run continuously (hourly updates)
python run_weather_pipeline.py continuous
```

### **Step 3: View the Dashboard**
1. Copy `nextjsweather/env.local.example` to `nextjsweather/.env.local`
2. The Next.js server should already be running at `http://localhost:3000`
3. Open your browser and visit the dashboard!

## 📊 What You'll See

### **Pipeline Output**
- Downloads fresh weather data from BoM FTP
- Parses 100+ weather stations
- Uploads to Supabase database
- Creates backup JSON files

### **Web Dashboard**
- **Current Weather**: Real-time conditions for all stations
- **Temperature Summary**: Highest, lowest, and average temperatures
- **Historical Charts**: 7-day temperature trends
- **Station Details**: Location, elevation, and measurements
- **Auto-refresh**: Updates every 5 minutes

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **If Supabase upload fails:**
1. Run the SQL from `fix_supabase_issues.sql` in Supabase
2. Check your `.env` file has correct credentials
3. Verify your Supabase project is active

### **If dashboard doesn't load:**
1. Make sure you copied `env.local.example` to `.env.local`
2. Check that the Next.js server is running
3. Verify the environment variables are correct

### **If parser fails:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify BoM FTP server is accessible
3. Check the `weather_pipeline.log` file

## 📈 Next Steps

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. **Fix Supabase**: Run the SQL fix script
2. **Test Pipeline**: Run `python run_weather_pipeline.py manual`
3. **View Dashboard**: Open `http://localhost:3000`

### **Future Enhancements:**
- Add historical data import from BOM
- Set up weather alerts
- Deploy to production (Vercel/Netlify)
- Add mobile app
- Implement real-time notifications

## 🎯 Key Features
